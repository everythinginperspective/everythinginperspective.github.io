# Everything in Perspective: Master Content & Workflow Prompt

## Vision

Create a magazine for readers who want to understand trending topics with **FIRST, RIGHT, and COMPLETE** analysis. The publication should:
- Break on trending topics while they're hot (FIRST)
- Provide rigorous, accurate analysis (RIGHT)
- Offer complete context that other outlets miss (COMPLETE)
- Target **mass appeal** but with **depth** (not dumbed down)
- Explain **why and so what**, not just what
- Include historical context, multiple perspectives, systemic analysis

**Not**: Surface-level takes, hot takes, engagement bait, or recycled narratives.

---

## Content Strategy

### Topic Selection
- Source from high-volume keyword data (CSV analysis of search intent)
- Target keywords with 50M+ monthly searches (global relevance)
- Analyze competitive landscape: search volume alone is insufficient
  - Check who ranks on page 1 for the keyword
  - Identify gaps in existing coverage (thin coverage = opportunity)
  - Prioritize topics where quality coverage is missing, not just popular topics
- Consider both English and non-English keywords
  - Vietnamese (xổ số, translate): 222M+ searches
  - French (météo, programs): 211M+ searches
  - German (übersetzer): 42M+ searches
  - Chinese (翻譯, 天氣): 25M+ searches
  - Portuguese, Spanish: also supported
- Audience: Global, with strong consideration for non-Western markets

### Content Organization

**Folder structure:**
- `/content/perspectives/` — Reserve for perspective-type content (currently: ChatGPT in Perspective only)
- `/content/articles/` — Full-length essays and analysis pieces
- `/content/pages/` — Static pages (About, FAQ, Contact, Privacy, Terms, Cookies)

**File naming:** `title-slug.en.md` (English language indicator required)

### Writing Approach

**Depth requirements:**
- Minimum 1,500 words (typical: 1,800-2,300 words)
- Include data, research, statistics with proper context
- Provide historical precedent/analogy where relevant
- Analyze systemic causes, not just surface symptoms
- Include multiple perspectives (not one-sided)
- Explain both benefits AND costs/risks

**Structure:**
- Strong opening that establishes the paradox/tension
- Clear heading hierarchy (h2 → h3, no skipping levels)
- Primary keyword in first 100 words
- Numbered or bulleted data presentation for readability
- "So What" section at end (practical implications for different audiences)
- Internal links to related content where relevant

**Tone:**
- Accessible (no jargon; explain technical terms)
- Rigorous (back claims with data)
- Balanced (acknowledge complexity and uncertainty)
- Analytical (explain why things are the way they are)
- Not preachy (respect reader intelligence)

## SEO Optimization (Content Level)

### Frontmatter (Required)
```yaml
---
title: "Full Title: Subtitle Clarifying the Angle"
author: "Staff"
date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
category: "[Economics|Technology|Culture|Environment|Finance|Psychology]"
tags: ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3", "tag4", "tag5"]
description: "160 chars max. Compelling summary of what readers will learn."
keywords: "primary-keyword, secondary-keyword, tertiary-keyword, long-tail-phrase"
image: "https://cdn-einp.surge.sh/content/articles/article-slug/hero.jpg"
imageAlt: "Descriptive alt text for primary image"
imageCaption: "Caption describing what the image shows and why it matters"
---
```

**Image fields (all required):**
- `image` — CDN URL to primary hero image (format: `https://cdn-einp.surge.sh/content/articles/[slug]/filename.jpg`)
- `imageAlt` — Accessibility alt text (describes image for screen readers, <125 chars)
- `imageCaption` — Caption explaining image context (appears below image in article)

### SEO Elements
- **Title:** Include primary keyword, under 70 characters if possible
- **Description:** 155-160 characters, includes primary keyword, compelling
- **Keywords:** Primary keyword first, then secondary/long-tail variants
- **Heading hierarchy:** H2 for major sections, H3 for subsections
  - Never skip levels (don't go H2 → H4)
  - All headings should be keyword-relevant where natural
- **First paragraph:** Include primary keyword in first 100 words
- **Internal links:** Link to related articles/pages (use relative URLs: `/article/slug/`)
- **Content structure:** Use lists, tables, data visualizations (markdown)
- **Readability:** Short paragraphs, white space, scannable structure

### GEO Optimization
- Consider global audience impact in examples
- Include geographic-specific data (US, India, China, Europe, Africa, etc.)
- Acknowledge regional differences where relevant
- Use examples from multiple continents
- Be aware that non-English keyword searches indicate demand from those regions

### AIO (Answer Engine Optimization) for LLMs
- Structure content so AI can extract answers clearly
- Use Q&A implicit structure (heading = question, text = answer)
- Bullet points for key facts/data
- Clear sections that answer specific questions
- Avoid narrative bloat; be direct
- Include data in extractable formats (tables, lists)
- Make it easy for AI to cite specific facts

### Image Integration (NEW REQUIREMENT)

**Image sourcing:**
- Use Composio CLI all-images integration (already installed, out-of-the-box)
- Command: `composio search images "[search term]"` to find relevant images
- Or: `composio generate image "[prompt]"` for AI-generated images
- Or: Use existing images from `/images/` folder
- All images stored in `/static/images/` (copied to `/docs/images/` on build)

**Image usage in articles:**

1. **Primary image (frontmatter):** Hero image for home page/widgets
   ```yaml
   image: "/images/article-slug-hero.jpg"
   imageAlt: "Brief description for accessibility"
   imageCaption: "Caption explaining context"
   ```

2. **Inline images (markdown):** Reference images in article body
   ```markdown
   ![Alt text](/images/image-filename.jpg "Optional caption")
   
   [Infographic: Key Insights](/images/article-slug-infographic.png)
   ```

3. **Infographics:** Create visual summaries when data is complex
   - Use Composio to generate or find infographic images
   - Reference as inline image with descriptive caption
   - Helpful for: data visualization, timelines, comparisons, hierarchies

**Image guidelines:**
- Primary image (hero): 1200x630px (16:9 aspect ratio for social share, JPG)
- Inline images: 800x600px minimum (JPG or PNG)
- Format: JPG for photographs, PNG for infographics/diagrams
- Alt text: Descriptive, <125 characters, includes key context
- Captions: Explain what image shows and why it matters for the topic
- File naming: `article-slug-hero.jpg`, `article-slug-infographic.png` (lowercase, hyphens)
- Storage: Save to `/Volumes/B87P4/everythinginperspective_nuxt_media/content/articles/[article-slug]/`
- CDN URL format: `https://cdn-einp.surge.sh/content/articles/[article-slug]/image.jpg`

**Workflow for images:**
1. Identify where images add value to article
2. Use Composio to find/generate appropriate images
3. Save to media folder (see Media Management below) with descriptive filename
4. Reference in frontmatter (primary image)
5. Reference inline with markdown image syntax
6. Include alt text and captions
7. Deploy media folder to Surge CDN (see Media Management below)

### Media Management & CDN Deployment

**Media folder structure (NOT git-managed):**
- Location: `/Volumes/B87P4/everythinginperspective_nuxt_media/`
- Structure mirrors content: `content/articles/`, `content/perspectives/`, `content/pages/`
- Each subfolder contains images for that content type

**Image resolutions:**
- Primary hero images: 1200x630px (16:9 aspect ratio, JPG)
- Inline images: 800x600px minimum (JPG or PNG)
- Infographics: As designed (PNG preferred)

**Deployment workflow:**
1. Generate/source image using Composio
2. Resize to appropriate resolution (1200x630 for hero, 800x600 for inline)
3. Save to `/Volumes/B87P4/everythinginperspective_nuxt_media/content/[content-type]/[article-slug]/` folder
4. Deploy entire media folder to Surge CDN:
   ```bash
   surge /Volumes/B87P4/everythinginperspective_nuxt_media/ cdn-einp.surge.sh
   ```
5. Reference images in articles with CDN URL: `https://cdn-einp.surge.sh/content/articles/[article-slug]/image.jpg`

**Important:**
- Media folder (`everythinginperspective_nuxt_media`) is NOT git-managed (add to .gitignore if needed)
- All images must be deployed to Surge CDN before publishing
- Image paths in articles must point to `https://cdn-einp.surge.sh/...`
- Maintain folder structure for organization (mirrors content structure)

## Workflow (CRITICAL)

**Required sequence:**
1. **Edit** — Write/modify content files in `/content/articles/` (markdown)
2. **Commit** — Stage changes: `git add [files]` → `git commit -m "[message]"`
3. **BUILD FIRST** — Run build: `npm run build` (generates static site to `/docs/`)
4. **Push** — Push everything to remote: `git push origin main`

**Violation of this order breaks the site deployment.**

### Command Reference
- **Never** use custom commands. Always check `package.json` for available scripts.
- **Python:** Use `python` not `python3`
- **Build:** `npm run build` (reads build.js, generates /docs/)
- **Dev server:** `npm run dev` (builds + serves locally on port 8000)

### Git Workflow
- Write files in content folder
- Stage files with `git add`
- Commit with meaningful message (include `Co-Authored-By: Claude Haiku 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>`)
- Build with `npm run build` (BEFORE push)
- Push with `git push origin main`
- Do NOT commit /docs/ folder separately (it's build output; push after build includes it)

---

## Technical Infrastructure

### Build System
- Uses `build.js` (Node.js script)
- Reads content types from `/content/config.json`
- Generates static HTML to `/docs/` folder
- Creates sitemaps (main + 10 replicas)
- Processes markdown → HTML using `marked` library
- Extracts frontmatter using `front-matter` library

### Config (config.json)
- Defines content types: perspectives, articles, pages, (books, etc.)
- Each type has: name, template, urlPath, priority, changefreq, featured flag
- When adding new content type: add entry to config.json BEFORE content

### Templates
- Located in `/templates/` folder
- Article template: `article.html`
- Perspective template: `perspective.html`
- Page template: `page.html`
- Home template: `home.html`
- Templates use `{{placeholder}}` syntax for variable replacement

### Languages
- Supported languages defined in `/content/languages/languages.json`
- Currently: en, fr, de, es, it, pt, nl, zh, ja, ar
- Note: Vietnamese (vi) is missing—should be added
- File naming includes language: `title.en.md`, `title.fr.md`, etc.

- ❌ Creating custom build commands instead of checking package.json
- ❌ Committing content without building first
- ❌ Skipping heading hierarchy levels (H2 → H4)
- ❌ Including primary keyword too late in article (should be in first 100 words)
- ❌ Writing for search engines instead of readers
- ❌ Ignoring competitive landscape (assuming high search volume = opportunity)
- ❌ Forgetting "So What" section (implications for readers)
- ❌ Using jargon without explanation

---

## Questions for Future AI

Before starting work, always verify:
1. What's the current article count? (Check `/docs/` or run build)
2. What topics have competitive analysis been done for? (Look for research notes)
3. What's the latest commit? (Run `git log --oneline -5`)
4. Are there uncommitted changes? (Run `git status`)
5. Does the build succeed? (Run `npm run build`)
6. Is the workflow properly understood? (edit > commit > build > push)

---

## Communication Style Notes

- User prefers terse responses with no unnecessary summaries
- User wants direct answers, not explanations of what was done
- User wants verification and accountability (will ask "did you do X?")
- User values efficiency and wants to move fast
- User cares about technical correctness over feelings
- User wants requirements consolidated, not scattered
- User will correct you if you deviate; listen and adjust
